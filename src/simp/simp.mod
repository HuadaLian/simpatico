   * \brief Simp namespace
   *
   * The Simp namespace contains classes that are more specific
   * to molecular simulation than those in the Util namespace 
   * but that (like those in Util) are avaialable for use in any
   * of (1) the McMd namespace for use in the single-processor 
   * mcSim and mdSim programs, (2) the DdMd for use in the ddSim 
   * parallel Md program, or (3) the Tools namespace for use in
   * postprocessing analysis tools.
   *
   * Currently, this namespace includes only interaction classes
   * that were previously in the Inter namespace. The intent is
   * to migrate some other classes into this namespace.
