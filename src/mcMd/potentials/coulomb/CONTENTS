This directory contains classes that implement an Ewald Coulomb 
interaction for the mdSim MD program.  Coulomb interactions are not 
yet implemented for the mcSim MC program.  Classes in this directory
are compiled iff the macro SIMP_COULOMB is defined.

Classes
-------

EwaldInteraction        - core rSpace and kSpace functions
MdCoulombPotential      - Base class for coulomb potentials
MdEwaldPotential        - Ewald implementation (k-Space summation)
EwaldRSpaceAccumulator  - utility class to hold energy and stress
